This was Dreamcatcher, a beautiful dream. It ended as so many idealist projects do
in this age of corporations and profits.  The requirement to leverage the innermost
thoughts and dreams of users towards company profit was too much cognitive
dissonance for the developers.

We hope that it can be a good example for those programming sites to connect and
share, and also that it perhaps can gain some new life in its open source incarnation.
