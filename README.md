This was Dreamcatcher, a beautiful dream. It ended as so many idealist projects do
in this age of corporations and profits.  

We hope that it can be a good example for those who program web apps to allow people to connect and

Hit me up about it and your enthusiasm may drive me to make it happen sooner!
